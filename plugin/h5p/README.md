H5P plugin
===
This plugin is only compatible with Chamilo version 1.11.10 and above.

This plugin allows you to create H5P resources directly from inside Chamilo,
using the Open Source H5P library.
However, it is still very limited at this stage: the H5P files are created in a
common directory for all teachers. This means all teachers can re-use contents of
others (which is good) but also that all teachers can remove contents of others
(which is bad).
We hope to be improving this in the future, but we will not be able, in future
versions, to assign content created in this version to the correct teacher.

We suggest you consider this plugin as a Beta version.

To enable tools in the document editor, please enable it in region pre_footer.
